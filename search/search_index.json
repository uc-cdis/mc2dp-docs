Goal \u00b6 Discover and study advanced precision technologies that will enable prevention, early detection, and enhanced treatments of cancers potentially arising due to exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards by military service members and veterans. Vision \u00b6 Integrate federal scientific platforms with public-private innovators revealing the impact of service-related exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards and developing prevention and early detection approaches and advanced treatments of cancers arising from these exposures. Capabilities \u00b6 Integrates multiple data commons and repositories, enabling seamless data connectivity and interoperability between various data sources. Represents a dynamic Data Ecosystem that aggregates and hosts metadata from multiple resources to make data discovery and access easy for users. MC2DP is powered by the open-source software \u201cGen3\u201d .

Learn more about the popular tool for data scientists on Jupyter.org (disclaimer: CTDS is not responsible for the content). Guidline to get started in Workspaces \u00b6 Once users have access to workspaces, use this guide below to get started with analysis work in workspaces. Users need to log in via https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/login to access workspaces. After navigating to https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/workspace, users will discover a list of pre-configured virtual machine (VM) images, as shown below. Click \u201cLaunch\u201d on any of the workspace options to spin up a copy of that VM. The status of launching the workspace is displayed after clicking on \u201cLaunch\u201d. Note: Launching the VM may take several minutes. After launching, the home folders are displayed. One of these folders is the user's persistent drive ( /pd ). Select the /pd folder. New files or licenses should be saved in the the /pd directory if users need to access them after restarting the workspaces. Only files saved in the /pd directory will remain available after termination of a workspace session. Use this folder to store files (notebooks, data files, etc) that you want to use again later. The files you save here will still be available when you come back after terminating your workspace session. Any files you create or add outside of this folder will be lost if they are not moved to the /pd before your workspace session terminates. Start a new notebook under \u201cNotebook\u201d in the Launcher tab. Click the tiles in the launcher and choose between Python 3 or R Studio as the base programmatic language. Experiment away! Code blocks are entered in cells, which can be executed individually or all at once. Code documentation and comments can also be entered in cells, and the cell type can be set to support Markdown. Do not forget to close your workspace once your work is finished. Unclosed workspaces continue to accrue computational costs. Note, Workspaces automatically shut down after several minutes of idle time.","title":"Getting Started in Workspace"},{"location":"workspace_start/#getting-started-in-workspaces","text":"MC2DP workspaces are secure data analysis environments in the cloud that can access data from one or more data resources.
