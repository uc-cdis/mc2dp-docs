The [**Murtha Cancer Center Data Platform (MC2DP)**](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/) is a Gen3 data mesh supporting the Prometheus Project. 

### Goal
Discover and study advanced precision technologies that will enable prevention, early detection, and enhanced treatments of cancers potentially arising due to exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards by military service members and veterans. 

### Vision
Integrate federal scientific platforms with public-private innovators revealing the impact of service-related exposures to environmental contaminants and toxin hazards and developing prevention and early detection approaches and advanced treatments of cancers arising from these exposures. 

### Capabilities
- Integrates multiple data commons and repositories, enabling seamless data connectivity and interoperability between various data sources.
- Represents a dynamic Data Ecosystem that aggregates and hosts metadata from multiple resources to make data discovery and access easy for users.

MC2DP is powered by the open-source software [“Gen3”](https://gen3.org).

>MC2DP was created by and is actively developed at the
>University of Chicago’s Center for Translational Data Science (CTDS) and the Open Commons Consortium (OCC)
>with the aim of creating interoperable cloud-based
>data resources for the scientific research community.
