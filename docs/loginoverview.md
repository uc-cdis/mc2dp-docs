# **Login Access Overview**

MC2DP is still under active development, so access to pages and data may change as a result.

All users are able to browse the study metadata in the [Explorer Page](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/Explorer) as well as other pages without logging in.

Users will need to log in to obtain authorization (access) in order to:
- Access the [Data Library Page](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/DataLibrary)
- Access the [Workspace Page](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/Workspace) and run interactive tutorial notebooks.

Start by visiting the [login page](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/Login)

Users are presented with two options:
- Login with Google: You may login using any Google account credentials, or a G-suite enabled institutional email. This option may or may not be available depending on the institution or organization the user is associated with.
- Login via ORCID: You can sign in using your ORCID iD credentials. This option may require your ORCID account to be linked to your institutional profile or application, depending on the organization’s requirements.

After successfully logging in, your username will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
