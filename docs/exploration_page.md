# **Exploration Page**

The primary tool for exploring data within MC2DP is the Exploration Page, which offers faceted search of data across data sources. This page can be accessed from the /explorer endpoint or the top navigation bar, by clicking on the “Exploration” icon.

The Exploration page is derived from a series of Elastic Search Indicies that enables a performant search and filter of all MC2DP metadata. Data cards display dynamic visual summaries of important dataset feature and the main data table below displays the available metadata records based on current filter selections. 

Users are able to build and save cohorts presented in the Explorer with the Cohort Selector tool.

### Cohort Selector in the Exploration Page

To build a cohort in the Exploration page, first create or select a cohort in the selection tool section.

Filters on the left control for several data attributes and update the main data displayed in the charts and tables as well as updates the cohort you're building.

The main table displays a sample of the data being selected.
