# **Security and Downloading Results**

MC2DP securely exposes study metadata and data files stored on multiple External FAIR repositories and Data Commons, i.e. data libraries or archives, to provide an easy way to connect different repositories on one single location.

Data is not directly located in MC2DP, so any raw data accessed in MC2DP is in fact accessed from the associated data resource.
