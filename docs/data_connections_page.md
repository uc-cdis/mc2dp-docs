# **Data Connections Page**

The [Data Connections Page](https://mc2dp.data-commons.org/DataConnections) provides users with a concurrent summary of the data contained in MC2DP via data connections.

The table summarizes data connection and is updated by the Data Curation team as connections are established or updated.

The legend specifies the manner of the connection made from an external source to MC2DP.  The categories include:
- (green) - connection established with real data
- (yellow) - connection established with synthetic data
- (red) - connection not worrking/connection pending/data pending
